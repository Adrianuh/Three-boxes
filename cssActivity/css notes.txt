CASCADING STYLE SHEETS (CSS)


1. Syntax
	selector {property: value; }

	The selector is usually the tag element that you want the style to belong to.

	eg.  body {
		text-align: center;
		font-family: Arial;
	        }

2. THE CASCADE
     In order of increasing importance:

	1) external style sheets: linked using a <link> tag to the css file
	2) embedded: styles defined inside the <head> tags
	3) inline: styles inside the tags themselves!

	This means that embedded styles will override external styles and inline styles will
	override embedded styles (ie. the closer you get to the actual objects on the page,
	the more important the styles defined are)

3. Inheritance

	You can define styles for tags more than once in a stylesheet and it will all be
	inherited!

4. Classes

	You can make up your own "classes" so that you can use certain styles
	like colour, background, etc. whenever you want!
